Day 2020-05-01, 10 apples and 8 oranges were sold (Difference  10 - 8 = 2).
Day 2020-05-02, 15 apples and 15 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 15 = 0).
Day 2020-05-03, 20 apples and 0 oranges were sold (Difference 20 - 0 = 20).
Day 2020-05-04, 15 apples and 16 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 16 = -1).

--ANSWER
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH cte1 as (
SELECT sale_date, sold_num as ap
FROM Sales
where fruit = "apples"
),
cte2 as (
SELECT sale_date, sold_num as org
FROM Sales
where fruit = "oranges"
)
SELECT c1.sale_date, ap - org as diff
FROM cte1 c1 join cte2 c2 ON c1.sale_date = c2.sale_date



--Nice approach
select sale_date, 
sum(case when fruit='apples' then sold_num else -sold_num end) as diff
from sales
group by sale_date


-- Clean SUM(IF()), GROUP BY
SELECT
    sale_date,
    SUM(IF(fruit = 'apples', sold_num, -sold_num)) AS diff
FROM Sales
GROUP BY sale_date
